# Design-Optimization-of-Drone-Arm-
An exploratory team project under Professor Pawan Sharma, Mechanical Dept, IIT BHU in which me alongwith my team tried to optimize drone arm structure using SIMP algorithm of SOLIDWORKS and using naturally topology optimized structres like gyroids. We evaluate their strength using Ansys Mechanical by Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
